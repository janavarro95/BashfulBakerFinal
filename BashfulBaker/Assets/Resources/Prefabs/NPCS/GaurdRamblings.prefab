  - You look super nervous!
  - Take a deep breath (LEFT TRIGGER)!
  - But not too fast (LEFT TRIGGER)!
  - Honesly Mint Chip Cookies are the best.
  - Rumor has it that Jeb's recipes are as old as baking itself!
  - Wait... have we met before?
  - Sometimes I wonder what we're protecting the town from...
  - Have you seen that raccoon around? I keep on having nightmares about it...
  - Dogs are great... when you don't get allergies!
  - When I first met Jeb, he would give me free dough all the time!
  - Sully's a great boss, bet he's an even better husband!
  - Have you met Ian and Brian? Those two boys just can't get enough of each other!
  - That barn scares me sometimes... I still don't know what's inside...
  - One time I made Sylvia mad for taking some of her mint without asking... boy oh
    boy was I foolish...
  - There used to be this super cute girl who lived in the Red house...
  - I went trecking in the woods a while ago, those trees just go on forever, I tell
    ya!
  - I hate these uniforms, it makes all look so... same-y...
  - Way back when, we would always snag some raisins when no one was looking... we
    dove into the bushes when they were!
  - Jeb can be kinda forgetful, but you know what? He's smarter than all of us!
  - You know Jeb sure is a wise fella...
  - Have you ever had the chance to try the cookies for yourself?
  - I can only imagine what it might be like in that kitchen...
